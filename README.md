# Customer-churn-prediction

>  Can you develop a model of machine learning that can predict customers who will leave the company?
   The aim is to estimate whether a bank's customers leave the bank or not. The event that defines the customer abandonment is the closing of the customer's bank account.
   
>  Logistic regression prediction gave me around 80% accuracy for customer churn prediction and that has still scope for better prediction after optimization.

>  As a part of customer retention program, this model can help management to make correct decisions on their future plans.
